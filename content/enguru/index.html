<h2>Enhancing Enguru's Plan Page: A UX/UI Case Study”</h2>
<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>Enguru, a leading language learning application, needed a user-friendly and visually appealing plan page to
    facilitate seamless access to premium features and resources. As a UX/UI designer, my task was to optimize this
    critical component of the app, enhancing the subscription process and improving the overall user experience. This
    case study details the process of creating an intuitive and engaging plan page that aligns with Enguru's educational
    objectives and caters to its diverse user base.</p>
<h3>User Research</h3>
<p>After conducting user research, several key insights have emerged that shed light on the user experience and
    usability of the Enguru app's plan page. These findings provide valuable perspectives that should guide our approach
    to enhancing this critical component of the application:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Concerns About Time Wasted:</strong> Users perceive the call request process as a significant
        time-waster. Waiting for a call and engaging in subscription discussions over the phone is considered a
        hindrance to a quick and straightforward subscription process.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Privacy Concerns:</strong> Users express reservations about sharing their phone number for a call back.
        They are concerned about potential unwanted calls and privacy issues.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Lack of Plan Details:</strong> The plan page lacks essential information about what users will gain with
        a subscription. The vague message, 'Let's find the best course for you at the best price for you. Our agent has
        the best offers for you. Request a call back,' leaves users uncertain about the value of the plans.
    </li>
    <li><strong>User Frustration:</strong> Many users report feeling frustrated and uncertain about their subscription
        decision due to the lack of information and the call request process. This frustration acts as a significant
        barrier to conversion.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Desire for Transparency:</strong> Users express a strong desire for transparency regarding available
        plans, their features, and associated costs. They want clear information about what they will gain from
        subscribing.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Preference for Self-Service:</strong> Users prefer self-service options, allowing them to select a plan
        and make a payment directly within the app without the need for a call.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Suggestion for Improved Communication:</strong> Users recommend clearer and more informative messaging
        on the plan page to help them make an informed decision. They want to know about the benefits of subscription
        upfront.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Privacy and Data Concerns:</strong> Users have concerns about how their contact information will be used
        and whether their data will be shared with third parties.
    </li>
    <li>AI tutor are not adequately mentioned: The presence and benefits of the AI tutor are not adequately mentioned or
        highlighted on the plan page.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Problems &amp; Solutions</h3>
<p><strong>Problem 1: Lack of Direct Payment Option</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>How might we:</strong> Enable users to make secure payments directly within the app, simplifying the
        subscription process?
    </li>
    <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Develop and integrate a user-friendly, secure in-app payment gateway, allowing users
        to select their desired plan and complete payments directly through the app. This will streamline the
        subscription process and reduce user frustration.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Problem 2: Time-Wasting Call Request Process</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>How might we:</strong> Streamline the subscription process to reduce user frustration and save time?
    </li>
    <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Provide users with the option to subscribe instantly within the app, eliminating the
        need for a call. Maintain the call request option for those who prefer personalized assistance, but make
        self-service the default and straightforward choice.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Problem 3: Lack of Plan Details and Transparency</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>How might we:</strong> Make plan details more transparent and readily available to users on the plan
        page?
    </li>
    <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Provide comprehensive plan descriptions, including features, pricing, and benefits,
        directly on the plan page. Ensure that users can easily access this information to enhance transparency.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Problem 4: Preference for Self-Service</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>How might we:</strong> Offer a self-service subscription option for users who prefer a more independent
        approach?
    </li>
    <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Introduce the capability for users to independently select and pay for plans within
        the app. This self-service option should reduce the reliance on calls for subscriptions.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Problem 5: Improve Communication</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>How might we:</strong> Improve communication on the plan page to effectively convey the benefits of
        subscribing and address user concerns?
    </li>
    <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Revise and optimize the messaging on the plan page to clearly convey the benefits of
        subscribing. Ensure that the messaging addresses user concerns and questions effectively.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Problem 6: Lack of Plan Details and Transparency (Including AI Tutor)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>How might we:</strong> Make plan details, including the presence and benefits of the AI tutor, more
        transparent and readily available to users on the plan page?
    </li>
    <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Provide comprehensive plan descriptions, including features, pricing, and benefits,
        directly on the plan page. Ensure that users can easily access information about the AI tutor, its capabilities,
        and how it enhances the learning experience. This will enhance transparency and highlight the value of the AI
        tutor as part of the subscription offering.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Ideation</h3>
<p>I leveraged the insights from user research to sketch and design the 'Plan' page of the Enguru app. This creative
    process allowed me to explore design concepts organically and ensure a user-friendly and engaging experience. The
    'Plan' page, as the gateway to premium features, benefits from clear layouts and informative content, all guided by
    the user-centric design principles.</p>
<p><img src="/content/enguru/sketch.png" alt="sketch"></p>
<ol>
    <li>When users open the home page and navigate to the 'Upgrade' option, instead of displaying a 'Request for a Call
        Back' page, it would be more user-centric to present the 'Upgrade' option directly. If a call is required, users
        should have the ability to initiate the call themselves. Users generally prefer to have control over the app,
        enabling them to make choices without being guided by the app. For the 'Call Us' or 'Contact Us' option, these
        provide clear and direct ways for users to get in touch with our support or sales team, bypassing the need for
        the lengthier 'Request for a Call Back' wording.
    </li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/content/enguru/design.png" alt="design"></p>
<ol>
    <li>From my perspective, shifting the messaging from 'Let's find a course for you' to '<strong>Unlock the learning
        journey'</strong> not only sounds more appealing but also better conveys the exciting potential for users.
        Additionally, <strong>it's crucial to highlight the value users can access by subscribing to our plans.</strong>
        This includes round-the-clock personalised learning with our AI tutor, daily practice lessons, engaging live
        classes, and top-tier guidance from our dedicated team of Enguru experts.”
    </li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/content/enguru/design2.png" alt="Design2"></p>
<p>From my perspective, the current layout of this page raises concerns. It prominently features a 'Request for a Call
    Back' button as the primary option, while 'Buy' is relegated to a secondary role, which appears to be an
    inappropriate hierarchy.</p>
<p>In addition to this, there are a few other notable issues:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The absence of direct, in-app payment options, which can cause unnecessary friction for users.</li>
    <li>Limited transparency about plan details, leaving users unsure about the benefits of subscribing.</li>
    <li>Privacy concerns regarding sharing contact information for call-back requests.</li>
    <li>The need for a clearer and more compelling call-to-action to encourage subscriptions.</li>
    <li>The potential to offer self-service subscription options for users who prefer independence in their choices.
    </li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/content/enguru/design3.png" alt="Design3"></p>
<p>Starting with this page, there are several key improvements needed. First, the pricing information is not prominently
    highlighted, and it lacks proper alignment with the '12-Month Premium' option. Users are more likely to expect
    various subscription options, so presenting a selection of choices is crucial.</p>
<p>In addition, the choice of words plays a significant role in user engagement. The existing text, 'New Topic Every
    Day,' 'Up to 12 Students Per Class,' and 'Structured English Course,' could be enhanced for a more captivating user
    experience. I've revised this to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>'Discover Something New Every Day' to create an engaging learning journey.</li>
    <li>'Enjoy Small Class Size, Up to 12 Students,' to emphasize personalized learning.</li>
    <li>'Follow a Step-by-Step English Course' to signify a structured and comprehensive learning experience.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>These revisions aim to make the page more user-friendly and engaging, ensuring a smoother user experience.</p>
