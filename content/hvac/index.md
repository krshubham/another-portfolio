### When it comes to users seeking HVAC services, there's not just one type. Let's break down the landscape based on various factors:

**By urgency:**
Emergency needs: These users require immediate repair due to sudden breakdowns or malfunctioning systems, particularly during extreme weather. They prioritise fast response times and availability.

_Scheduled maintenance:_ Proactive users seeking routine tune-ups or filter replacements to ensure peak performance and prevent future issues. They value convenience and flexible scheduling options.

_New system installation:_ Users looking to replace outdated or underperforming systems. They're interested in efficiency ratings, cost estimates, and financing options.

**By demographics:**
Homeowners: The most common user group, typically responsible for maintaining their home's HVAC system. They may have varying levels of technical knowledge and budget constraints.

_Renters:_ May require repairs or installations, but the responsibility might fall on the landlord. They prioritize clear communication with both property managers and service providers.

_Businesses:_ Commercial properties require robust and reliable HVAC systems. Businesses often value preventative maintenance and long-term service contracts.

**By additional factors:**
_Tech-savvy users:_ Prefer online scheduling, service estimates, and communication channels. They might value interactive online tools or AI-powered chatbots.

_Cost-conscious users:_ Seek affordable options and compare prices before committing. They appreciate transparent pricing and promotional offers.

_Environmentally conscious users:_ Prioritize energy-efficient solutions and sustainable practices. They're interested in green technologies and certifications.
