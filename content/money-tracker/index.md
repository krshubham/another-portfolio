## Design Process

### Paper sketch

I sketched out the main pages of my budgeting app based on the insights I gained from user research. This helped me to explore design ideas in a more organic and free-flowing way. The app has 4 main pages: overview, analytics, plans, and goals. I also sketched a step-by-step guide on how to set up a new account and create a monthly budget

### Digital Wireframes

I digitized my hand-drawn sketches to create digital wireframes for my Money tracker app project. This allowed me to create a more detailed and interactive representation of the user interfaces, which will help me to improve the user experience and ensure that the app meets the needs of my users.

## Usability Study

I created a low-fidelity prototype of my budgeting app project to test the functionality and usability of the app. The prototype is made up of simple shapes and text, and it does not include any styling or animations. This allows me to focus on the core features of the app and to get feedback from users early on in the development process.

- Users find the homepage cluttered, affecting user experience.
- Simplify the homepage layout to improve user focus.

**Goal Page Reminder Button:**

- Users miss a reminder button on the Goal page to help them stay within budget limits.
- Add an accessible reminder feature for budget limit notifications.

**Month Button on Goal Page:**

- Users can't switch between months on the Goal page easily.
- Include a month button for seamless month-to-month tracking.

**Search Bar:**

- Users have requested a search bar, which is currently missing.
- Introduce a search bar for enhanced user navigation and content accessibility.

## Digital Wireframe (Updated version)

After carefully reviewing the feedback from our usability study, I took action to enhance the digital wireframes. These changes were made with our users in mind, aiming to create a smoother and more user-friendly experience.”

## Design System

### Choice Of Colour : **Blue**

I've decided to use blue for my Money Tracker app because it signifies trust and reliability, qualities that are essential when managing personal finances. Blue also conveys a sense of calmness, which can be reassuring when users are dealing with financial matters. It's a universally liked color and aligns well with the professionalism required in financial apps. Additionally, blue's association with cleanliness and efficiency makes it a great choice for a tool designed to help users organize their financial lives.”
