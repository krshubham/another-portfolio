## Problem

The problem at hand is the lack of convenience and accessibility in the gardening and plant shopping experience. Homeowners struggle to find reliable gardeners for landscaping services, while plant enthusiasts face challenges in sourcing a diverse range of plants. Current solutions lack a unified digital platform, leading to fragmented and unsatisfactory user experiences. The Gardenezy App project seeks to address these issues by providing a comprehensive solution. It bridges the gap between users and gardening services, offering a curated plant catalogue, secure booking, and real-time service tracking. This project aims to revolutionise gardening and plant shopping, making it easier and more enjoyable for users to bring nature into their lives.

## Defining the problem

The problem being addressed is the lack of a seamless and efficient platform that connects users with skilled gardeners for landscaping services and provides a diverse and accessible catalog for purchasing plants. This problem encompasses several key issues:

1. **Difficulty in Finding Reliable Gardeners:** Homeowners often struggle to find trustworthy and experienced gardeners for landscaping and garden maintenance, leading to frustration and uncertainty in managing their outdoor spaces.
2. **Limited Plant Options:** Plant enthusiasts face challenges in discovering a wide range of indoor and outdoor plants that suit their preferences and local climate conditions.
3. **Fragmented User Experience:** The absence of a unified digital platform for gardening services and plant shopping results in a disjointed and inconvenient user journey, leading to inefficiencies and dissatisfaction.
4. **Lack of Real-time Tracking:** Users often lack the ability to track the progress of gardening services and the status of their plant orders in real-time, causing uncertainty and inconvenience.
5. **Complex Booking and Transactions:** Existing solutions may lack user-friendly interfaces and secure transaction processes, making it challenging for users to book services and purchase plants confidently.

    ## How might we ?
    
    In the development of the "GardenEsy" app, my primary goal is to create a user-centric platform that empowers gardening enthusiasts of all levels. I aim to simplify gardening tasks, offer personalised guidance, and foster a sense of community, making it easier and more enjoyable for users to connect with nature. With this vision in mind, I've formulated a set of "How might we" (HMW) questions to guide our innovation and problem-solving efforts:
    
    **How might we** simplify the process of ordering a wide variety of plants for users, ensuring an effortless shopping experience?
    
    **How might we** enhance the onboarding experience for users with varying levels of gardening expertise to make the app accessible to beginners and experts alike?
    
    **How might we** integrate real-time tracking and communication features to enable users to monitor the progress of their gardening service bookings seamlessly?
    
    **How might we** leverage user feedback and reviews to continuously improve the app's features, content, and overall user experience?
    
    **How might we** implement eco-friendly and sustainable practices within the app to cater to environmentally conscious users?
    
    **How might we** make the app adaptable to different mobile devices and operating systems to ensure accessibility for a broad user base?
    
    **How might we** establish partnerships with local nurseries or suppliers to offer users a diverse and high-quality selection of plants and gardening supplies?
    
    These HMW questions will serve as my guiding principles in the pursuit of a user-friendly, innovative, and comprehensive gardening app.
