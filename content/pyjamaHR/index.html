<h2>Case Study: Pyjama HR Candidate Pipeline Screen</h2>
<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p><strong>I</strong> <strong>wanted to enhance the User Interface: Redesigning PyjamaHR's Candidate Pipeline
    Screen</strong><br/><br/>
    In the pursuit of refining user experience and aligning with modern design trends, I embarked on the task of
    redesigning PyjamaHR's candidate pipeline screen. My primary objective was to elevate usability, aesthetics, and
    overall user satisfaction within this specific interface. By employing user-centric design strategies and a focus on
    contemporary design elements, I aimed to transform the candidate pipeline screen into a more intuitive and visually
    appealing segment of the PyjamaHR website. This project stands as a testament to my commitment to creating
    impactful and user-friendly designs, emphasizing both functionality and aesthetics in the realm of user interface
    design.</p>
<h3>Research and Conceptualization</h3>
<p><strong>Analysing the current UI, identifying its strengths and weaknesses</strong></p>
<p>Based on my analysis of the current UI, I have identified some strengths and weaknesses of the website from a product
    design perspective. I have categorised the issues into major and minor ones, and explained the reasons and possible
    solutions for each of them. I have also highlighted some positive aspects of the website that enhance the user
    experience and satisfaction. Here is a summary of my findings:</p>
<p><em>Strengths</em></p>
<ul>

    <ul>
        <li>The home page font and job page fonts are different, which affects the consistency and branding of the website.</li>
        <li>The padding issue affects the layout and alignment of the website.</li>
        <li>The keyword input box and experience input box are very light, which affects the visibility and affordance of the
            website.</li>
        <li>The spacing on filter card and spacing on candidate status card are not the same, which affects the consistency and
            layout of the website.</li>
        <li>The question mark and bell icon look like two different types of icons, which affects the consistency and branding of
            the website.</li>

<h3>User Research</h3>
<p>In order to design a better UI/UX for Pyjamahr, I conducted user research to identify the pain points that users
    face when using the product. I used various research methods, product data, user interviews, qualitative market
    research, service safari,user journey mapping,and product reviews. Based on my research, I found that the main pain
    points that users experience are related to</p>
<p><em>Inconsistent or unclear UI design</em>: The user may find it hard to understand or use the UI elements, such as
    the labels, icons, colors, or menus. The user may also find it confusing or frustrating if the UI design is not
    consistent across the website or the product.</p>
<p><em>Cluttered interface</em>: Some users have complained that the website has a cluttered interface that makes it
    hard to navigate and find the relevant information. For example, one user said, “Cluttered interface. Some features
    lack intuitive integration. Reporting and analytics could be improved.</p>
<p><em>Slow performance</em>: Some users have experienced slow loading times and glitches with PyjamaHR. For example,
    one user said, “Slow. Sometimes it takes too long to load the candidates or the jobs. Sometimes it crashes and logs
    me out.” Another user said, “We face sometimes glitches with PyjamaHR</p>
<p><em>Kanban Board</em>: Just doesn’t look like kan ban board as a first time user it was difficult to make out.</p>

<h3>Insights Driving Redesign Decisions</h3>
<p>In my exploration of PyjamaHR's job screen, I delved into both primary and secondary research to identify ways to
    enhance user experience (UX) and user interface (UI).
    Through interviews and testing with users, I uncovered what they found difficult and what could be improved.
    Alongside this, I studied how similar apps in the industry work, learning from their
    successes and shortcomings. This research pinpointed areas needing improvement, such as better spacing, clearer
    colors, and easier understanding of how the app functions. Armed with these insights,
    I undertook a redesign to ensure PyjamaHR's job screen offers a more user-friendly and efficient experience.</p>
<p>Rationale for Design Changes:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Spacing and Layout Improvement:
            Reasoning: Proper spacing between elements and components was introduced to enhance the overall UI
            experience.
            Benefits: Improved spacing allows for better visual hierarchy, reducing clutter, and aiding users in
            navigating the interface more easily. Clearer separation between elements enhances readability and
            comprehension.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Color Scheme Modifications:
            Boost Button: Changed the color scheme of the boost button from a yellow border to a filled light yellow
            button.
            Reasoning: The initial yellow border was visually attention-grabbing, but filling the button with light
            yellow maintains attention while being less overwhelming.
            Benefits: The revised color scheme maintains visibility while reducing visual strain, creating a more
            balanced and aesthetically pleasing interface.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Filter Card and Kanban Board Enhancement:
            Changes Made: Implemented distinct card formats to enhance visibility and emphasize the board as a Kanban
            system.
            Reasoning: The initial Kanban board lacked clear card differentiation, hindering its identification as a
            Kanban system.
            Benefits: Introducing diverse card formats within the Kanban board aids in visually distinguishing tasks or
            items, allowing users to recognize and interact with the board more effectively.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Changes in Call-to-action button:
            Changes Made: Repositioned call-to-action buttons to optimize user interaction and accessibility within the
            interface.
            Reasoning: The initial placement of call-to-action buttons may have led to user interaction challenges or
            hindered user flow within the app. Adjusting their position aimed to streamline user engagement and improve
            accessibility.
            Benefits: By relocating the call-to-action buttons to a more intuitive or prominent position, users can
            access and engage with key functions more effortlessly, potentially enhancing overall user experience and
            encouraging desired
            interactions within the app.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>How Design Improves User Experience and Engagement:</h4>
<p><em>Enhanced Visual Clarity:</em>
    Improved spacing and layout contribute to a cleaner and more organized interface, reducing cognitive load and making
    navigation more intuitive.</p>
<p><em>Reduced Visual Overload:</em>
    Changes in the boost button's color scheme help maintain user attention without overwhelming them, promoting better
    engagement</p>
<p><em>Improved Functionality Understanding:</em>
    The introduction of different colors for cards in the Kanban board enhances users' understanding of the board's
    functionality, facilitating easier task management and interaction.</p>
<p><em>Increased Aesthetics and Appeal:</em>
    Overall, these design changes aim to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, fostering a positive
    user experience and potentially increasing user engagement with the platform.</p>
<p><em>Streamlined Access to Key Functions:</em>
    Repositioning the call-to-action buttons optimizes their placement for improved access to vital app functions,
    enabling users to swiftly engage with primary actions.</p>
<p><em>Prototype Showcase:</em></p>
<p>Including prototypes showcasing these changes provides stakeholders and users with a tangible visualization of the
    proposed improvements, making it easier to understand and assess the impact of the redesign on the user experience.
    By detailing the reasoning behind each design change and how it contributes to improving user experience and
    engagement, you'll effectively communicate the thought process and benefits of your redesign decisions in your case
