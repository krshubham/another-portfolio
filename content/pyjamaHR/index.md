# Case Study Pyajama HR Candidate Pipeline Screen


## Project Overview

**I** **wanted to Enhance the User Interface: Redesigning PyajamaHR's Candidate Pipeline Screen**
In the pursuit of refining user experience and aligning with modern design trends, I embarked on the task of redesigning PyajamaHR's candidate pipeline screen. My primary objective was to elevate usability, aesthetics, and overall user satisfaction within this specific interface. By employing user-centric design strategies and a focus on contemporary design elements, I aimed to transform the candidate pipeline screen into a more intuitive and visually appealing segment of the PyajamaHR website. This project stands as a testament to my commitment to creating impactful and user-friendly designs, emphasizing both functionality and aesthetics in the realm of user interface design.

## Research and Conceptualization

**Analysing the current UI, identifying its strengths and weaknesses**

Based on my analysis of the current UI, I have identified some strengths and weaknesses of the website from a product design perspective. I have categorised the issues into major and minor ones, and explained the reasons and possible solutions for each of them. I have also highlighted some positive aspects of the website that enhance the user experience and satisfaction. Here is a summary of my findings:

_Strengths_

The website has a simple and clean design that is easy to navigate and understand.

The website has a consistent and coherent colour scheme that matches the brand identity and logo.

The website has a responsive and adaptive design that works well on different devices and screen sizes.

The website has a user-friendly and intuitive interface that provides clear and helpful feedback and guidance to the users.

_Weaknesses_

**Major issues**

The Boost Button with color yellow is not visible with white background, which affects the visibility and accessibility of the website.

The search bar looks half cut until you don’t click on it, which affects the usability and affordance of the website.

The page shows completely blank when it is taking time to load, which affects the user experience and perceived performance of the website.

**Minor issues**

The home page font and job page fonts are different, which affects the consistency and branding of the website.

The padding issue affects the layout and alignment of the website.

The keyword input box and experience input box are very light, which affects the visibility and affordance of the website.

The spacing on filter card and spacing on candidate status card are not the same, which affects the consistency and layout of the website.

The question mark and bell icon look like two different types of icons, which affects the consistency and branding of the website.

## User Research ## 

In order to design a better UI/UX for Pyajamahr, I conducted user research to identify the pain points that users face when using the product. I used various research methods, product data, user interviews, qualitative market research, service safari,user journey mapping,and product reviews. Based on my research, I found that the main pain points that users experience are related to

_Inconsistent or unclear UI design_: The user may find it hard to understand or use the UI elements, such as the labels, icons, colors, or menus. The user may also find it confusing or frustrating if the UI design is not consistent across the website or the product.

_Cluttered interface_: Some users have complained that the website has a cluttered interface that makes it hard to navigate and find the relevant information. For example, one user said, “Cluttered interface. Some features lack intuitive integration. Reporting and analytics could be improved.

_Slow performance_: Some users have experienced slow loading times and glitches with PyjamaHR. For example, one user said, “Slow. Sometimes it takes too long to load the candidates or the jobs. Sometimes it crashes and logs me out.” Another user said, “We face sometimes glitches with PyjamaHR

_Kanban Board_: Just doesn’t look like kan ban board as a first time user it was difficult to make out.

## Insights Driving Redesign Decisions

In my exploration of PyajamaHR's job screen, I delved into both primary and secondary research to identify ways to enhance user experience (UX) and user interface (UI).
Through interviews and testing with users, I uncovered what they found difficult and what could be improved. Alongside this, I studied how similar apps in the industry work, learning from their
successes and shortcomings. This research pinpointed areas needing improvement, such as better spacing, clearer colors, and easier understanding of how the app functions. Armed with these insights,
I undertook a redesign to ensure PyajamaHR's job screen offers a more user-friendly and efficient experience.

Rationale for Design Changes:
1. Spacing and Layout Improvement:
   Reasoning: Proper spacing between elements and components was introduced to enhance the overall UI experience.
   Benefits: Improved spacing allows for better visual hierarchy, reducing clutter, and aiding users in navigating the interface more easily. Clearer separation between elements enhances readability and comprehension.

2. Color Scheme Modifications:
   Boost Button: Changed the color scheme of the boost button from a yellow border to a filled light yellow button.
   Reasoning: The initial yellow border was visually attention-grabbing, but filling the button with light yellow maintains attention while being less overwhelming.
   Benefits: The revised color scheme maintains visibility while reducing visual strain, creating a more balanced and aesthetically pleasing interface.

3. Filter Card and Kanban Board Enhancement:
   Changes Made: Implemented distinct card formats to enhance visibility and emphasize the board as a Kanban system.
   Reasoning: The initial Kanban board lacked clear card differentiation, hindering its identification as a Kanban system.
   Benefits: Introducing diverse card formats within the Kanban board aids in visually distinguishing tasks or items, allowing users to recognize and interact with the board more effectively.

4. Changes in Call-to-action button:
   Changes Made: Repositioned call-to-action buttons to optimize user interaction and accessibility within the interface.
   Reasoning: The initial placement of call-to-action buttons may have led to user interaction challenges or hindered user flow within the app. Adjusting their position aimed to streamline user engagement and improve accessibility.
   Benefits: By relocating the call-to-action buttons to a more intuitive or prominent position, users can access and engage with key functions more effortlessly, potentially enhancing overall user experience and encouraging desired
   interactions within the app.

### How Design Improves User Experience and Engagement:

_Enhanced Visual Clarity:_
Improved spacing and layout contribute to a cleaner and more organized interface, reducing cognitive load and making navigation more intuitive.

_Reduced Visual Overload:_
Changes in the boost button's color scheme help maintain user attention without overwhelming them, promoting better engagement

_Improved Functionality Understanding:_
The introduction of different colors for cards in the Kanban board enhances users' understanding of the board's functionality, facilitating easier task management and interaction.

_Increased Aesthetics and Appeal:_
Overall, these design changes aim to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, fostering a positive user experience and potentially increasing user engagement with the platform.

_Streamlined Access to Key Functions:_
Repositioning the call-to-action buttons optimizes their placement for improved access to vital app functions, enabling users to swiftly engage with primary actions.

_Prototype Showcase:_

Including prototypes showcasing these changes provides stakeholders and users with a tangible visualization of the proposed improvements, making it easier to understand and assess the impact of the redesign on the user experience.
By detailing the reasoning behind each design change and how it contributes to improving user experience and engagement, you'll effectively communicate the thought process and benefits of your redesign decisions in your case study.
